# **Adria Cross — Personal Stylist**

### ***It’s not your body, it’s your wardrobe.***

Helping women and men fall back in love with their clothes — by creating confidence through style that fits who you are, how you live, and where you’re headed.

## **Home — Your First Impression**

You’ve built a life you love — a career, a family, a routine that runs on ambition and purpose.  
 But when it comes to your closet? It doesn’t reflect the person you’ve become.

You have *so many* clothes, but nothing feels right. You rotate the same few outfits, debate wearing the “nicer” one, and wonder what’s even clean. Dressing for the day has turned into a mental drain instead of something that feels inspiring.

That’s where I come in.

I help you simplify, refine, and rebuild your wardrobe so that every outfit feels effortless — and entirely *you.*

## **What I Do**

**Rediscover your style. Save time. Feel unstoppable.**

I help high-performing individuals reclaim confidence through a curated, wearable wardrobe — without the overwhelm, waste, or guesswork.

✔ A closet that actually works for your lifestyle  
 ✔ Outfits that make you feel confident every day  
 ✔ A luxe, practical approach to real-world dressing

*All services are available virtually or in-person. Flexible scheduling for busy professionals and parents.*

## **Is This You?**

* You have a closet full of clothes but only wear the same three “go-to” outfits.

* You debate wearing your nicer pieces because you don’t want to seem *overdressed.*

* You’re tired of wondering what’s clean or what goes together.

* You own plenty of clothes but don’t know *how* to mix them with what you already have.

* You want to look confident and polished — without spending extra time or energy.

If that sounds familiar, your wardrobe isn’t the problem — it just needs direction.

## **About Me**

Hi, I’m **Adria** — wife, mom to two amazing girls, CrossFit coach, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blue belt.

Fashion has always been my creative outlet. As a little girl, I would spend hours putting on fashion shows, restyling my dolls, and experimenting with looks long before I knew what “styling” was.

Today, that same passion fuels my mission: helping real people feel confident in what they wear — not just for events or photos, but every day.

I know what it’s like to juggle family, work, and wellness while still wanting to look and feel your best. My approach combines personal empowerment with practicality — I create wardrobes that are both luxurious and livable.

I believe getting dressed should never feel stressful. It should feel *like you.*

---

## **Who I Work With**

I work with women and men who have built successful, full lives — people who value excellence in everything they do and are ready for their wardrobe to reflect that same energy.

My clients are professionals, entrepreneurs, parents, and go-getters who appreciate quality but need their style to be effortless. They want a wardrobe that moves with their life — one that looks polished without feeling overdone.

Whether you’re refreshing your look, redefining your image, or simply ready to feel like your best self again — I’m here to make that happen.

---

## **My Promise**

I’ll help you find your personal style and make your wardrobe work harder for you — without starting from scratch.

My services feel luxurious but are rooted in practicality, confidence, and transformation.

Because the truth is simple:  
 **It’s not your body, it’s your wardrobe.**
