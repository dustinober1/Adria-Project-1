## Data Storage Architecture

The application uses a **hybrid storage approach**:
- **CSV files** for user data, blog articles, and email lists (simpler deployment)
- **File system** for wardrobe images (paid tier feature)
- **PostgreSQL schema** defined but not required (optional upgrade path)

This approach makes the application **easy to deploy** without requiring database setup, while maintaining the ability to upgrade to PostgreSQL later.

## Customer Readiness Assessment

### ✅ READY FOR DELIVERY
- All core features functional
- Server starts and responds correctly
- Authentication system working
- Admin features operational
- Frontend responsive and functional
- Documentation complete

### ⚠️ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POST-DELIVERY
1. **Security Updates:** Monitor for express-validator updates
2. **CSP Enhancement:** Add `upgradeInsecureRequests` for production
3. **Database Migration:** Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for scalability
4. **SSL Certificate:** Implement HTTPS for production deployment

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start for Customer:
1. Install Node.js (v14+)
2. Extract project files
3. Run `npm install`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
5. Run `npm start`
6. Access at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Deployment:
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Configure production database (optional)
3. Set up reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
4. Implement SSL/TLS
5. Configure domain and DNS

## Conclusion

The Adria Style Studio application is **fully functional and ready for customer delivery**. The minor security issues identified do not impact core functionality and can be addressed in post-delivery updates.
