        <p class="article-subtitle" style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;">Helping women and men fall back in love with their clothes — by creating confidence through style that fits who you are, how you live, and where you're headed.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Home — Your First Impression</h2>
            <p>You've built a life you love — a career, a family, a routine that runs on ambition and purpose. But when it comes to your closet? It doesn't reflect the person you've become.</p>
            <p>You have so many clothes, but nothing feels right. You rotate the same few outfits, debate wearing the "nicer" one, and wonder what's even clean. Dressing for the day has turned into a mental drain instead of something that feels inspiring.</p>
            <p><strong>That's where I come in.</strong></p>
            <p>I help you simplify, refine, and rebuild your wardrobe so that every outfit feels effortless — and entirely you.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You have a closet full of clothes but only wear the same three "go-to" outfits.</li>
                <li>You debate wearing your nicer pieces because you don't want to seem overdressed.</li>
                <li>You're tired of wondering what's clean or what goes together.</li>
                <li>You own plenty of clothes but don't know how to mix them with what you already have.</li>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Adria — wife, mom to two amazing girls, CrossFit coach, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blue belt.</p>
            <p>Fashion has always been my creative outlet. As a little girl, I would spend hours putting on fashion shows, restyling my dolls, and experimenting with looks long before I knew what "styling" was.</p>
            <p>Today, that same passion fuels my mission: helping real people feel confident in what they wear — not just for events or photos, but every day.</p>
            <p>I know what it's like to juggle family, work, and wellness while still wanting to look and feel your best. My approach combines personal empowerment with practicality — I create wardrobes that are both luxurious and livable.</p>
            <p><strong>I believe getting dressed should never feel stressful. It should feel like you.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
            <p>I work with women and men who have built successful, full lives — people who value excellence in everything they do and are ready for their wardrobe to reflect that same energy.</p>
            <p>My clients are professionals, entrepreneurs, parents, and go-getters who appreciate quality but need their style to be effortless. They want a wardrobe that moves with their life — one that looks polished without feeling overdone.</p>
            <p>Whether you're refreshing your look, redefining your image, or simply ready to feel like your best self again — I'm here to make that happen.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">

            <p>My services feel luxurious but are rooted in practicality, confidence, and transformation.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #c19a5d; font-size: 1.1rem;">Because the truth is simple: <em>It's not your body, it's your wardrobe.</em></p>
