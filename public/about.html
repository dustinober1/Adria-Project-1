        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Hi, I'm <strong>Adria</strong> — wife, mom to two amazing girls, CrossFit coach, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blue belt.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Fashion has always been my creative outlet. As a little girl, I would spend hours putting on fashion shows, restyling my dolls, and experimenting with looks long before I knew what "styling" was.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Today, that same passion fuels my mission: helping real people feel confident in what they wear — not just for events or photos, but every day.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I know what it's like to juggle family, work, and wellness while still wanting to look and feel your best. My approach combines personal empowerment with practicality — I create wardrobes that are both luxurious and livable.</p>
            <p><strong>I believe getting dressed should never feel stressful. It should feel like you.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>My Promise</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I'll help you find your personal style and make your wardrobe work harder for you — without starting from scratch.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">My services feel luxurious but are rooted in practicality, confidence, and transformation.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #c19a5d; font-size: 1.1rem;">Because the truth is simple: <em>It's not your body, it's your wardrobe.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I work with women and men who have built successful, full lives — people who value excellence in everything they do and are ready for their wardrobe to reflect that same energy.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">My clients are professionals, entrepreneurs, parents, and go-getters who appreciate quality but need their style to be effortless. They want a wardrobe that moves with their life — one that looks polished without feeling overdone.</p>
            <p>Whether you're refreshing your look, redefining your image, or simply ready to feel like your best self again — I'm here to make that happen.</p>
