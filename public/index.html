                <p>
                    You've built a life you love â€” a career, a family, a routine that runs on ambition and purpose.<br>
                    But when it comes to your closet? It doesn't reflect the person you've become.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have <em>so many</em> clothes, but nothing feels right. You rotate the same few outfits, debate wearing the "nicer" one, and wonder what's even clean. Dressing for the day has turned into a mental drain instead of something that feels inspiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where I come in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I help you simplify, refine, and rebuild your wardrobe so that every outfit feels effortless â€” and entirely <em>you.</em>

            <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Adria</strong> â€” wife, mom to two amazing girls, CrossFit coach, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blue belt.</p>
            <p>Fashion has always been my creative outlet. As a little girl, I would spend hours putting on fashion shows, restyling my dolls, and experimenting with looks long before I knew what "styling" was.</p>
            <p>Today, that same passion fuels my mission: helping real people feel confident in what they wear â€” not just for events or photos, but every day.</p>
            <p>I know what it's like to juggle family, work, and wellness while still wanting to look and feel your best. My approach combines personal empowerment with practicality â€” I create wardrobes that are both luxurious and livable.</p>
            <p>I believe getting dressed should never feel stressful. It should feel <em>like you.</em></p>

                Whether you're refreshing your look, redefining your image, or simply ready to feel like your best self again â€” I'm here to make that happen.
