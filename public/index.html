        <h1>Adria Cross — Personal Stylist</h1>
        <p class="article-subtitle"><em>It's not your body, it's your wardrobe.</em></p>
        <p class="article-subtitle" style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;">Helping women and men fall back in love with their clothes — by creating confidence through style that fits who you are, how you live, and where you're headed.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Home — Your First Impression</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">You've built a life you love — a career, a family, a routine that runs on ambition and purpose. But when it comes to your closet? It doesn't reflect the person you've become.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">You have <em>so many</em> clothes, but nothing feels right. You rotate the same few outfits, debate wearing the "nicer" one, and wonder what's even clean. Dressing for the day has turned into a mental drain instead of something that feels inspiring.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>That's where I come in.</strong></p>
            <p>I help you simplify, refine, and rebuild your wardrobe so that every outfit feels effortless — and entirely you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>What I Do</h2>

                <li>✔ A closet that actually works for your lifestyle</li>
                <li>✔ Outfits that make you feel confident every day</li>

            </ul>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Is This You?</h2>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                <li>You have a closet full of clothes but only wear the same three "go-to" outfits.</li>
                <li>You debate wearing your nicer pieces because you don't want to seem <em>overdressed.</em></li>
                <li>You're tired of wondering what's clean or what goes together.</li>
                <li>You own plenty of clothes but don't know <em>how</em> to mix them with what you already have.</li>
                <li>You want to look confident and polished — without spending extra time or energy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #c19a5d; margin-top: 1rem;">If that sounds familiar, your wardrobe isn't the problem — it just needs direction.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Hi, I'm <strong>Adria</strong> — wife, mom to two amazing girls, CrossFit coach, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blue belt.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Fashion has always been my creative outlet. As a little girl, I would spend hours putting on fashion shows, restyling my dolls, and experimenting with looks long before I knew what "styling" was.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Today, that same passion fuels my mission: helping real people feel confident in what they wear — not just for events or photos, but every day.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I know what it's like to juggle family, work, and wellness while still wanting to look and feel your best. My approach combines personal empowerment with practicality — I create wardrobes that are both luxurious and livable.</p>
            <p><strong>I believe getting dressed should never feel stressful. It should feel like you.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I work with women and men who have built successful, full lives — people who value excellence in everything they do and are ready for their wardrobe to reflect that same energy.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">My clients are professionals, entrepreneurs, parents, and go-getters who appreciate quality but need their style to be effortless. They want a wardrobe that moves with their life — one that looks polished without feeling overdone.</p>
            <p>Whether you're refreshing your look, redefining your image, or simply ready to feel like your best self again — I'm here to make that happen.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>My Promise</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I'll help you find your personal style and make your wardrobe work harder for you — without starting from scratch.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">My services feel luxurious but are rooted in practicality, confidence, and transformation.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #c19a5d; font-size: 1.1rem;">Because the truth is simple: <em>It's not your body, it's your wardrobe.</em></p>
