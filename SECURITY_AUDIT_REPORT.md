# Security Audit Report - Adria Style Studio

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Review System  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit examined the Adria Style Studio web application for security vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and functional integrity. The application demonstrates strong security practices with several areas requiring attention.

## Overall Security Rating: **B+ (Good)**

### Strengths
- Strong authentication and authorization implementation
- Proper use of security headers via Helmet
- HTTP-only cookies for JWT tokens
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Proper CORS configuration

### Areas for Improvement
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- CSV-based data storage
- Limited logging in production
- Missing security headers configurations
- No CSRF protection implementation

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Authentication & Authorization ✅ **SECURE**

**Findings:**
- JWT tokens properly signed and verified
- HTTP-only, secure, sameSite cookies prevent XSS attacks
- Proper token expiration handling
- Strong password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Admin authorization middleware properly implemented

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing refresh tokens for better security
- Add account lockout after failed attempts

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization ✅ **SECURE**

**Findings:**
- Express-validator used for input validation
- Email normalization and validation
- Password length requirements (min 6 characters)
- Slug validation for blog articles
- Proper error handling for validation failures

**Recommendations:**
- Increase minimum password length to 8 characters
- Add password complexity requirements
- Implement server-side XSS sanitization for user content

### 3. Security Headers ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

**Findings:**
- Helmet middleware implemented with CSP
- Content Security Policy configured but could be stricter
- Missing some important security headers

**Current CSP Configuration:**
```javascript
defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
connectSrc: ["'self'", "http://localhost:3000"]
```

**Recommendations:**
- Remove 'unsafe-inline' from styleSrc if possible
- Add frame-ancestors directive to prevent clickjacking
- Implement stricter CSP for production
- Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Add Referrer-Policy header
- Add Permissions-Policy header

### 4. Data Storage & Database Security ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

**Findings:**
- CSV-based storage for user data (unusual for production)
- No database encryption at rest
- File-based storage susceptible to race conditions
- No backup mechanism implemented

**Recommendations:**
- Migrate to proper database (PostgreSQL as suggested in .env.example)
- Implement database encryption
- Add data backup and recovery procedures
- Consider database connection pooling

### 5. Session Management ✅ **SECURE**

**Findings:**
- HTTP-only cookies prevent client-side access
- Secure flag set in production
- SameSite=strict prevents CSRF
- Proper token expiration (7 days)
- Secure logout implementation clears cookies

**Recommendations:**
- Consider shorter token expiration with refresh tokens
- Implement token revocation on logout

### 6. Error Handling & Logging ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

**Findings:**
- Error messages properly sanitized in production
- Development vs production error handling
- Logging suppressed in production (good for security)
- No centralized logging system

**Recommendations:**
- Implement structured logging for security monitoring
- Add security event logging (login attempts, admin actions)
- Consider log aggregation service for production
- Implement alerting for suspicious activities

### 7. Dependency Security ⚠️ **VULNERABILITIES FOUND**

**Findings:**
- 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities identified
- Validator.js URL validation bypass vulnerability
- Express-validator depends on vulnerable validator package

**Vulnerable Packages:**
- validator@* (URL validation bypass - GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx)
- express-validator@* (depends on vulnerable validator)

**Recommendations:**
- Update or replace validator package
- Monitor for security updates regularly
- Implement automated dependency scanning
- Consider alternative validation libraries

### 8. File Security ✅ **SECURE**

**Findings:**
- .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files
- Environment files excluded from version control
- Data directory excluded from git
- No sensitive files in public directory

**Recommendations:**
- Add .env.example to .gitignore (currently not excluded)
- Ensure proper file permissions on data directory

### 9. CORS Configuration ✅ **SECURE**

**Findings:**
- CORS properly configured with specific origin
- Credentials allowed for authenticated requests
- Environment-based configuration

**Recommendations:**
- Use whitelist approach for multiple origins in production
- Consider more restrictive CORS policies

### 10. API Security ✅ **SECURE**

**Findings:**
- Proper authentication middleware on protected routes
- Admin authorization implemented
- Input validation on API endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes
- No information leakage in error messages

**Recommendations:**
- Implement API versioning
- Add request size limits
- Consider API rate limiting beyond authentication

## Functionality Test Results

### Authentication Flow ✅ **WORKING**
- User registration: ✅ PASS
- User login: ✅ PASS  
- Token validation: ✅ PASS
- Protected route access: ✅ PASS
- Admin authorization: ✅ PASS (properly blocks non-admin users)

### Server Operations ✅ **WORKING**
- Server startup: ✅ PASS
- Health endpoint: ✅ PASS
- Static file serving: ✅ PASS
- Error handling: ✅ PASS

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Immediate Action Required)
1. **Fix Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   - Update or replace validator package
   - Implement automated security scanning

2. **Improve Security Headers**
   - Remove 'unsafe-inline' from CSP
   - Add missing security headers
   - Implement stricter CSP for production

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

   - Implement data encryption at rest
   - Add backup procedures

4. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Implement security event logging
   - Add centralized log management
   - Set up alerting system

### Low Priority (Future Improvements)
5. **Session Enhancements**
   - Implement refresh tokens
   - Add token revocation
   - Consider session timeout policies

6. **Additional Security Features**

|----------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Authentication | 9/10 | 20% | 1.8 |
| Authorization | 9/10 | 15% | 1.35 |
| Input Validation | 8/10 | 15% | 1.2 |
| Security Headers | 7/10 | 10% | 0.7 |
| Data Storage | 6/10 | 15% | 0.9 |

| File Security | 9/10 | 5% | 0.45 |

**Overall Score: 8.6/10 (B+)**

## Conclusion

The Adria Style Studio application demonstrates strong security foundations with proper authentication, authorization, and basic security measures. The primary concerns are around dependency management, data storage architecture, and some security header configurations. With the recommended improvements, this application can achieve enterprise-grade security standards.

**Next Steps:**
1. Address high-priority dependency vulnerabilities
2. Implement enhanced security headers
3. Plan database migration from CSV to proper database
