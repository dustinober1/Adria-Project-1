# Admin Login Fix Todo List

- [x] Examine current admin login flow
- [x] Check authentication logic in auth.js
- [x] Review admin.js for redirect handling
- [x] Examine backend authentication endpoints
- [x] Identify and fix redirect issues
- [x] Test admin login functionality

## Summary

The issue was that the admin.js file was calling API endpoints without the `/api` prefix. The backend expects all API endpoints to start with `/api/`, but the frontend was calling endpoints like:

- `/auth/me` instead of `/api/auth/me`
- `/admin/stats` instead of `/api/admin/stats`
- `/admin/users` instead of `/api/admin/users`
- etc.

## Fixed Endpoints

All API endpoints in admin.js have been updated to include the `/api` prefix:

1. Authentication endpoints:
   - `/api/auth/me` - Check current user
   - `/api/auth/logout` - Logout user

2. Admin dashboard endpoints:
   - `/api/admin/stats` - Get dashboard statistics
   - `/api/admin/users` - Get all users
   - `/api/admin/users/{id}` - Get user details
   - `/api/admin/users/{id}/promote` - Promote user to admin
   - `/api/admin/users/{id}/demote` - Demote admin to user
   - `/api/admin/users/{id}` - Delete user
   - `/api/admin/users/{id}/tier` - Update user tier
   - `/api/admin/users/{id}/status` - Update user status
   - `/api/admin/users/{id}/notes` - Update user notes

3. Article management endpoints:
   - `/api/admin/articles` - Get all articles
   - `/api/admin/articles` - Create new article
   - `/api/admin/articles/{id}` - Get article details
   - `/api/admin/articles/{id}` - Update article
   - `/api/admin/articles/{id}` - Delete article

## Test Results

The backend server is running successfully and all API endpoints are now responding with 200 OK status codes. The admin login redirection issue has been resolved.
